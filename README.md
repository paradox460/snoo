# Snoo

[![API Testing](https://img.shields.io/badge/API%20Test-RapidAPI-blue.svg)](https://rapidapi.com/package/Reddit/functions?utm_source=RedditGithub&utm_medium=button&utm_content=Vender_GitHub)

Snoo is a *simple* wrapper for the reddit.com api. Its designed to provide an interface as close to the official api as possible, while freeing you from the problems of dealing with json, webserver requests, and session/cookie management.

Unlike other API wrappers, this one doesn't make use of complicated objects or classes, once you instantiate it once, you are good to go.

Since it's designed to be simple, it leaves things like rate limiting up to you. Please follow the [reddit api rules](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API) and only send one request every 2 seconds (you can use `sleep 2` between requests).

Also, if you build programs with it, please change the user agent to your specific use case.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'snoo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install snoo

## Usage

Here's a simple script that sends a private message:

```ruby
require 'snoo'

# Create a new instance of the client
reddit = Snoo::Client.new

# Log into reddit
reddit.log_in 'Username', 'Password'

# Send a private message to me (Paradox!)
reddit.send_pm 'Paradox', 'Snoo rubygem rocks!', "Hey Paradox, I'm trying your Snoo rubygem out and it rocks. Thanks for providing such an awesome thing!"

# Log back out of reddit
reddit.log_out
```

See the [docs](http://rubydoc.info/github/paradox460/snoo/) for more info.
